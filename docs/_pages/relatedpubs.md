The following publications have either used a version of the VBR Calculator or contributed directly towards writing the code:

* **Havlin, Holtzman and Hopper, 2020.** Inference of thermodynamic state in the asthenosphere from anelastic properties, with applications to North American upper mantle. In review at PEPI, pre-print available soon.
* **Holtzman, B.K., 2016.** Questions on the existence, persistence, and mechanical effects of a very small melt fraction in the asthenosphere. Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems 17, 470–484.
* **Bellis, C., Holtzman, B., 2014.** Sensitivity of seismic measurements to frequency-dependent attenuation and upper mantle structure: an initial approach. Journal of Geophysical Research doi:10.1002/2013JB010831.
* **Lau, H.C., Holtzman, B.K., 2019.** “measures of dissipation in viscoelastic media” extended: Toward continuous characterization across very broad geophysical time scales. Geophysical Research Letters 46, 9544–9553.
