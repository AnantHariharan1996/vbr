The code is in Matlab, but it is functional in [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). Installation is as simple as downloading the code, of which there are two options:
* Clone from [the github stable branch](https://github.com/vbr-calc/vbr/tree/stable)
* Download a [zip file of the latest stable release](https://github.com/vbr-calc/vbr/releases/latest)

### Notes for GNU Octave users

The VBR Calculator nominally works in GNU Octave, but you may find that you need to install some packages:

* [How to install packages](https://octave.org/doc/interpreter/Installing-and-Removing-Packages.html)
* [IO package](https://octave.sourceforge.io/io/index.html)
* [statistics package](https://octave.sourceforge.io/statistics/index.html)
